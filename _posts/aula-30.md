**Æ3** - Leia:

I live on a farm with many animals. There is a cat and a dog that are my pets. They play together every day. Near the farm, there is a big elephant in the zoo.

In the forest, I saw a bear and many birds flying in the sky. Sometimes, a buffalo comes to the river to drink water.

On the farm, there are many cows and chickens. The camel is special because it can walk a long way in the desert.

By the lake, I saw a duck swimming. In the woods, a deer runs very fast. In the ocean, there are dolphins jumping happily.

Above the trees, an eagle flies high. I also saw an emu walking slowly. Near the river, an eel swims quietly.

At night, a fox walks in the forest. Near the pond, a frog jumps on the leaves. In the water, many fish swim happily.

I love animals because they are interesting and fun. Each animal has a special place where it lives. I like to learn about all of them.
